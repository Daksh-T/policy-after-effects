# Policy After Effects
A simple TUI app that lets you view potential second and third order effects of policies

## Why?
It is hard for people to think of nth order effects of their actions. We humans behave in complex ways and it is not easy to anticipate what kind of side effects our decisions may cause. Policy After Effects is meant to help with this.

## How to use?
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set your GROQ API key as an environment variable by using `$env:GROQ_API_KEY = 'your-api-key'` on PowerShell or `export GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key'` on Bash
4. Launch the app by running `python app.py`
